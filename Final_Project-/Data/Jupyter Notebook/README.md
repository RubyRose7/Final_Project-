# Project_Final

# Introduction 

Our final project focuses on how Twitter can help investors predict the price of the Stock Market. Investors need to understand trends in the market in order to decide whether to buy and sell a stock. However, it is a difficult task to understand the behavior of the market. In stock investing, it is important to stay current with what is going on in the world, because these behaviors affect the stock market. In addition, many people are turning to "influencers" when deciding which stock to buy or sell. Many "influencers" like to push their stock or their predictions on social media platforms such as Twitter. 

Our team decided to analyse how Twitter affects the price of certain stocks.

# Sentiment Analysis

Since AI cannot detect human emotion, we have to add value to these words through Sentiment Analysis. In our approach, we had tokenized the tweets and assigned a value to them from -1 to 1. The polarity of these tweets would allow us to classify these tweets as positive or negative. 

# Stock Data 
We focused on 6 stocks:
    *AMZN
    *TSLA
    *GOOGL
    *MRNA
    *PFE
