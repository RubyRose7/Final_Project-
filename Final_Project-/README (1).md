# About The Project 

#### This project focuses on how Twitter can help investors predict the price of the Stock Market. Investors need to understand market trends in order to decide whether to buy and sell a stock. However, it is difficult  to understand the behavior of the market. 

#### In stock investing, it is important to stay current with what is going on in the world, because these behaviors affect the stock market. The younger crowd, namely Gen Z and Millenials,  are turning to "influencers"  and Social Media when deciding which stock to buy or sell. 

#### The main objective of this project, therefore, is to analyze how tweets from Twitter affects the prices of certain stocks.
